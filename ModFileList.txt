/*Discription:
 * Rigt now we have 1 dungeon with 2 screen: it's pretty easy 2 add more screens now;
   Marga's implemented (player momvent range) is available, but no combat system yet.
   I suggest enemy(combat system) developer read MapManager first and figure what's
   going on.

 * Second Activity.mxl has been mod: Background, button change to imagebutton
 * Main2Activity.java has been mod: becuz the change of 2nd Act.mxl
 
 * Mapmange.java: Now we maps have been created. Used an ArrayList to handle each map
                 add 1 more int variable to determine the page of map.
                 add 1 more ArrayList<ArrayList<Tile>>  

 * GamePanel.java: add 1 int variable, some functions from MapManager have been changed
		   for example, Constructor(Content, int pageNumber)
